# Tutorial

**How to use it** :) **TUTORIAL**

First download the zip file from the releases which is on your corner eye. Then open the zip and extract to anywhere.
Then double tap the **exe** and open it. 

From here, once it is opened you then want to hop into your game as the options of aimbot are above in preview
Once you're in the game, click on the button you want then

Maximize your game (if you want it works best) or just leave your game in your current size
This will then start the aimbot and it will work when it locks on to the persons head
